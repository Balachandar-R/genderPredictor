# genderPredictor #
GenderPredictor is a wrapper around [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)'s [Naive Bayes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) classifier for predicting the gender given a name.

This problem is common when dealing with incomplete contact information for users.

Currently it appears to be about 80% accurate on American names but this is just the framework.
The name files are from the [US Census](http://www.census.gov/genealogy/names/names_files.html) and are [in the public domain](https://ask.census.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/782/).
